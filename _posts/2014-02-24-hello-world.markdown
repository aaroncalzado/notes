Hello world! Here I am trying to blog again. In this blog you will find writings, thoughts, and process logs on current things Iâ€™m working on. This blog is primarily written for myself as an ongoing process blog because I did such a shitty job documenting my process while I was studying design school. I also feel this blog may be helpful for other designers interested in observing their peers struggle while honing their craft through blood, sweat, caffeine, and [tears](http://conangifs.tumblr.com/post/10862111894/my-tears-make-me-stronger "tears"). I will try my best to maintain this blog. Until next time!
