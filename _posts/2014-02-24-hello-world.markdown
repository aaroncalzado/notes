Hello world! Here I am trying to blog again. In this blog you will find notes, thoughts, and process documentation on projects Iâ€™m currently working on. This blog is primarily written for myself to practice my writing and improve the documentation for my projects. I also feel this blog may be useful for other designers interested in reading about my progress as a designer. I will try my best to maintain this blog.

Enjoy!
